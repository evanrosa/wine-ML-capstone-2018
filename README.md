## Project Objective(s)

#### Description
Our final project asks you to apply your skills to a business problem of your choice. The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your team, division, or organization. Youâ€™ll generate a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

#### Deliverables
You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Part 1: Project Proposal/Data**: Describe your chosen problem and whether you have access to relevant data. A link to your data source is appreciated.
- **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Share a summary of your initial analysis. Notebook should contain a thorough analysis and description of your data as well as relevant graphics. The goal is that the reader underderstands the shape and nature of the data you are working with. 
- **Part 3: Modeling/Results**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code, processes, model, and results. The format of this notebook should resemble a medium-length memo.
- **Part 4: Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.

Your project is meant to resemble an actual client deliverable. Your audience is a client. Parts 2 and 3 should be clean notebooks that you would feel comfortable presenting to a client. Part 4, the presentation, should resemble an actual client meeting in which you present your finds.

> "Everyone is your client." -Dr. Albert Lee

## Project Resources

* [Check out our requirements doc](./requirements.md) for a detailed walkthrough of our final project deliverable requirements.
* If you're looking for final project ideas, [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) is an excellent resource for free and open data. As always, you may not use work data for this project! It is also wise to not use anything related to your current work projects

## Project Schedule

- Part 1: 
	- For classes that meet Mon/Weds and Tues/Thurs, due **Friday, May 11th**
	- For classes that meet Fridays, due **Tuesday, May 15th**
- Part 2: 
	- For classes that meet Mon/Weds and Tues/Thurs, due **TBA**
	- For classes that meet Fridays, due **TBA**
- Part 3:
	- For classes that meet Mon/Weds and Tues/Thurs, due **TBA**
	- For classes that meet Fridays, due **TBA**
- Part 4 (Final):
	- Your presentations will be between 5 to 7 minutes, with time for Q&A filling a 10-minute block.
	- Final presentations are given in the last two days of class (for the Friday class, this is the last day).
	- If you will not be present in your scheduled time, it is your responsibility to organize to have your presentation earlier.
	- Due to the class size, to break up monotony, you may elect to give your final presentation any time within the last 3 class days. (For the Friday class, this means the last _two_ weeks, morning or afternoon).

## Rubric

Part 1 is on a 0/1 scale (it is complete or it is not). For all deliverables (ie, Parts 2, 3, and 4 above), requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

Your final project is therefore out of a total of 7 points. A 6 or higher is required for passing this assessment, and passing this assessment is required for passing this course. Do not count on receiving 3s, as they are given subjectively to above-and-beyond analyses.

## Project Submission

Instructors will explain how to submit project deliverables. Depending on the deliverable, this may be done by:

- Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor.
- Creating a document or slide deck/PDF to share with an audience.
