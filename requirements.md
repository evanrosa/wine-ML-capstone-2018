## Final Project, Part 1: Pitch
> Test and validate 2–3 initial ideas.

In the field of data science, projects are practical. One of the best ways to quickly test ideas is to share your ideas with others and get feedback. Start by reviewing the requirements and [suggested data sets](./datasets.md), then generate a list of 2–3 potential ideas you'd like to pursue. 

**Requirements**
1. Generate 2–3 different possible problem statements (of at least 250 words each).
    - State the questions you seek to answer, data set suggestions, and possible challenges.
2. Create a written pitch for each possibility that can be shared with your instructor and classmates.
3. Submit or present your pitch as required by your instructor.

#### Submission
- Submit or share your project proposal as per your instructor's directions.

<a name="proposal"></a>
## Final Project, Part 2: Proposal
> Select data and outline specific goals.

Based on the feedback your received in Part 1, expand on your initial proposal. Spend more time looking through the data sets and outline the initial logic of your approach in a detailed problem statement. 

For this write up, describe your hypothesis and assumptions, articulate your specific aim and success metrics, and state any risks or limitations. Make sure you've also explained which data set you've selected for this project and why.

As before, make sure to review the requirements and [suggested data sets](./datasets.md) while preparing your proposal.

**Requirements**
1. Restate your specific problem statement.
2. Expand on your initial proposal by including:
   - Hypothesis/assumptions
   - Goals and success metrics
   - Risks or limitations
3. Articulate the specific data set you've chosen and why.

#### Submission
- Submit or share your project proposal as per your instructor's directions.

## Final Project, Part 3: EDA Brief
> Perform EDA on your dataset

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in any data workflow. Create a Jupyter Notebook that explores your data mathematically and visually. Explore features, apply descriptive statistics, look at distributions, and determine how to handle sampling or any missing values.

**Requirements**
1. Create an exploratory data analysis notebook.
2. Perform statistical analysis, along with any visualizations.
3. Determine how to handle sampling or missing values.
4 Clearly identify shortcomings, assumptions, and next steps.

#### Submission
- Submit or share your project brief as per your instructor's directions.

<a name="notebook"></a>
## Final Project, Part 4: Technical Notebook
> Build and document a working model, prototype, recommendation, or solution.

Your goal for this project is to develop a prototype model or process to successfully resolve the business problem you've chosen. Document your work in a technical notebook that can be shared with your peers.

Build upon your earlier analysis, folling the performance metrics you established as part of your problem's evaluation criteria. Demonstrate your approach logically, including all relevant code and data. Polish your notebook for peer audiences by cleanly formatting sections, headers, and descriptions in markdown. Include comments in any code.

**Requirements**
1. A detailed Jupyter Notebook with a summary of your analysis, approach, and evaluation metrics.
2. Clearly formatted structure with section headings and markdown descriptions.
3. Comments explaining your code.

> Note: Here are some things to consider in your notebook: sample size, correlations, feature importance, unexplained variance or outliers, variable selection, train/test comparison, and any relationships between your target and independent variables.

#### Submission
- Submit or share your project proposal as per your instructor's directions.

<a name="presentation"></a>
## Final Project, Part 5: Presentation
> Summarize and present your findings.

Present your findings to an audience that may include both technical and non-technical executive stakeholders. Summarize and break down your problem, approach, and recommendations in a manner that different levels of expertise will find informative and persuasive.

Start with a short executive summary of your problem, solution, and recommendation in a one page document or blog post. This will force you to be concise while creating a sharable struture for your presentation.

Next, create a presentation that progresses through your project in a similar manner. Provide details and visuals. Keep slides simple - no more than 2-3 pieces of information per slide. 

Explain your goals, approach, results, and recommendations. Finally, be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

> **Optional:** As a stretch challenge, try: creating an interactive demo of your model in action, explaining how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discussing how to evaluate model performance over time.

**Requirements**
1. One-page executive summary
2. Detailed presentation for non-technical audience.
3. Your presentation should include:
   - A problem statement.
   - Initial metrics and assumptions.
   - Your approach and process.
   - A data model.
   - Your performance evaluation (compared to original success metrics).
   - The impact of your findings and any recommendations.
   - Suggestions for implementation or next steps.

 4. *Optional:* Create/host an interactive demo of your model, explain how to deploy your model, or describe how you would evaluate performance over time.
