    "In our last linear model we're using all non-numeric columns (which include dummy columns) to predict our 'y' or points value. It performed almost exactly like our second linear model. So, what does this mean? I would suggest that we should look at the coefficients and use only the strongest correlated. More data doesn't nessecarily have more impact or influence on our prediction."

    "When trying to predict wine point reviews, when compared to the null RMSE of 3.04, our linear regression is better at predicting points with a RMSE of 2.66. That said, it still isn't a reliable model due to our low R-squared value of 0.23. Moreover, our best regression model was the Random Forest with a RMSE of 2.3. In terms of our random forest regression model, the argument can be made that adjusting the tuning parameters could help the model perform better, however, I wasn't able to do so due to the amount of computing resources it required. \n",

    "When trying to predict good or bad wine, our logistic regression model did a pretty good job. Basically, I classified wines over a 92 rating as being a good wine, which is 3 points higher than the mean and one point less than top 75% percentile. After we ran the model our accuracy score was 91, however, it was only a 1% increase from the null. That said, if we were to increase our threshold for a good wine, to let's say 95, we would expect a more accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while this isn't enough to use for a real world problem, it is our best model when trying to predict the point rating value or good/bad wine. Also, feature importance for each model didn't changed too much from model to model. Each model listed the most important characteristics of wine, according to this dataset, as price and the various varieties of wine. Lastly, in the future, we will aim to develop more reliable models to predict the point rating. If I could make a recommendation, I would ask to have a full review of the wine to coincide with the point rating. "
